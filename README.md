# T-SQL Portfolio Projects

Welcome to my T-SQL portfolio! This repository showcases my SQL Server development skills using popular public datasets such as AdventureWorks, WideWorldImporters, IMDb, and Stack Overflow.

Each subproject includes a curated collection of SQL scripts for:

- 📊 Data exploration & analysis
- ⚙️ Stored procedures and user-defined functions
- 🚀 Query performance tuning and optimization
- 🛠️ Setup and configuration scripts

The goal is to demonstrate real-world problem solving, efficient query design, and deep familiarity with the T-SQL language.
